The Bazel team is happy to announce a new version of Bazel, [Bazel 0.26](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/tag/0.26.0).

## Incompatible changes

- [`--incompatible_windows_escape_jvm_flags`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7486)
  is enabled by default, and removed.

- [`--incompatible_windows_style_arg_escaping`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7454)
  is enabled by default.

- [`--incompatible_no_output_attr_default`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7950)
  is enabled by default.

- [`--incompatible_depset_union`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5817)
  is enabled by default.

- [`--incompatible_disable_genrule_cc_toolchain_dependency`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6867) removed

- [`--Incompatible_disallow_rule_execution_platform_constraints_allowed`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8136):
  When enabled, disallows the use of the `execution_platform_constraints_allowed`
  attribute when defining new rules.

- [`--incompatible_disable_objc_provider_resources`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5710)
  is now enabled by default.

## Apple

- The `--ios_multi_cpus`, `--watchos_cpus`, `--macos_cpus` and `--tvos_cpus` are
  now additive. This means that you can now split the `--ios_multi_cpus=arm64,armv7`
  into `--ios_multi_cpus=arm64` and `--ios_multi_cpus=armv7`.

- Add `--incompatible_objc_framework_cleanup` to control whether to enable some
  objc framework cleanup that changes the API. Specifically, the cleanup changes
  the objc provider API pertaining to frameworks. This change is expected to be
  transparent to most users unless they write their own Starlark rules to handle
  frameworks. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7594 for details.

- `objc_library` does not support resource attributes any more. Please read
  [#7594](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7594) for more info.

## Android

- Android resource conflicts will no longer be reported between a strong attr
  resource and a weak attr resource, if the weak attr does not have format
  specified.

## C++

- [Allow debugging C++ features logic](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/commit/53156db1e30fe7197889c3cbc8d1321ff9b85143)

- Add new options [`--cs_fdo_instrument`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.26.0/command-line-reference.html#flag--cs_fdo_instrument)
  and [`--cs_fdo_profile`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.26.0/command-line-reference.html#flag--cs_fdo_profile)
  to support LLVM's context-sensitive FDO (CSFDO).

- [Bazel C++ compile/link Starlark API](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/4570).
  Can be used with experimental flag `--experimental_cc_skylark_api_enabled_packages`.

- [`cc_toolchain.static_runtime_lib`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.26.0/be/c-cpp.html#cc_toolchain.static_runtime_lib
  and [`cc_toolchain.dynamic_runtime_lib`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.26.0/be/c-cpp.html#cc_toolchain.dynamic_runtime_lib)
  are now exposed to Starlark.

- C++ Starlark API for compilation and linking is no longer whitelisted

- Incompatible flag `--incompatible_make_thinlto_command_lines_standalone` has
  been added. See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6791 for details.

- Feature `disable_whole_archive_for_static_lib` has been added to allow turning
  off legacy_whole_archive for individual targets.
  https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7362

## Python

- Fixed an issue where some `py_runtimes` were incompatible with using
  `--build_python_zip` ([#5104](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5104)).

## Starlark

- The flag [`--incompatible_restrict_named_params`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8147)
  is added. [Buildifier](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools) will soon be
  updated to automatically fix this in your code.

- The flag [`--incompatible_no_kwargs_in_build_files`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8021)
  is added. It fixes a bug where the `**kwarg` notation was allowed in `BUILD`
  files.

- The flag [`--incompatible_static_name_resolution_in_build_files`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8022)
  is added. This fixes a bug where invalid code was silently accepted.

- The flag [`--incompatible_disallow_old_octal_notation`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/8059)
  is added. It removes a deprecated notation for octal numbers.
  [Buildifier](https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools) can update your code
  automatically.

- [`struct.to_proto()`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.26.0/skylark/lib/struct.html#to_proto)
  can now convert dictionaries into proto3 text message.

- The [`glob`](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.26.0/be/functions.html#glob)
  function has a new argument `allow_empty`. When set to `False` (this will be
  the default in the future), the glob fails when it doesn't match anything.
  Please explicitly set `allow_empty = True` to the globs that need it.

## Windows

- Windows, Python: the new `--incompatible_windows_escape_python_args` flag
  (`false` by default) builds `py_binary` and `py_test` targets with correct
  command line argument escaping. Similar to
  https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7486 but for `py_*` rules.

## Other changes

- cquery supports `--output=build`

- Generated Go protobufs now depend on `//net/proto2/go:proto_gendeps` instead
  of `//net/proto2/go:proto`

- Added `--incompatible_remove_binary_profile` to disable the old binary
  profiles. Instead use the JSON profile format:
  https://docs.bazel.build/versions/0.26.0/skylark/performance.html#json-profile

- Introducing `--execution_log_binary_file` and `--execution_log_json_file`
  that output a stable sorted execution log. They will offer a stable
  replacement to `--experimental_execution_log_file`.

- New platform_mappings ability to allow gradual flag to platforms/toolchains
  migration. See also https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6426

- Added support for compiling against fully qualified `R` classes from
  `aar_import` dependencies.

- `--tls_enabled` flag is deprecated. Please provide `grpcs` as a scheme in
  the URLs if TLS should be used for a remote connection.
