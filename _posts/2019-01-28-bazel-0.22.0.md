## General Changes

- https://docs.bazel.build now supports versioned
  documentation. Use the selector at the top of the navigation bar
  to switch between documentation for different Bazel releases.

- set `projectId` in all `PublishBuildToolEventStreamRequest`

## Android

- mobile-install now works with aapt2. Try it out with `bazel
  mobile-install --android_aapt=aapt2 //my:target`

- Fixed issues with mobile-install v1 when deploying to Android 9 Pie
  devices. https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/6814

- Fixed issue where error messages from Android manifest merging
  actions were not fully propagated.

- New incompatible change flag `--incompatible_use_aapt2_by_default`
  for defaulting to aapt2 in Android builds has been added. To build with
  aapt2 today, pass the flag
  `--incompatible_use_aapt2_by_default=true` or
  `--android_aapt=aapt2`, or set the `aapt_version`  to `aapt2` on
  your `android_binary` or `android_local_test` target.

- Fixed mobile-install v1 error when installing an app with native
  libraries onto an Android 9 (Pie) device. See
  https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/issues/77

- Fixed a mobile-install bug where `arm64-v8a` libraries were not
  deployed correctly on `arm64` devices. This was done by enabling
  incremental native lib deployment by default. A previously
  undocumented `--android_incremental_native_libs` flag is removed,
  and is now the regular behavior. See
  https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/2239

## Apple

- The `objc_bundle` rule has been removed. Please migrate to rules_apple's
  [apple_bundle_import](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple/bl
  ob/master/doc/rules-resources.md#apple_bundle_import).

- The `apple_stub_binary` rule has been deleted.

- The `--xbinary_fdo` option that passes xbinary profiles has been added.

## C++

- `cc_toolchain.(static|dynamic)_runtime_libs` attributes are now optional

## Packaging

- `build_tar.py` in `tools/build_defs/pkg` now supports a JSON manifest
  that can be used to add paths that have symbols that can't be
  specified via the command line

## Query

- Filtering of inputs, outputs, and mnemonic filtering have been added to
  aquery.

- The aquery and cquery query2 tests have been open-sourced.

- The Bazel query how-to recommends ":*" instead of ":all", because "all" might
  be the name of a target.

## Testing

- The `--runs_per_test` has been placed in the TESTING documentation category.

- A a clarifying message has been added to test case summary output when all
  test cases pass but the target fails.
